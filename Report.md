# Design and analysis of 3D printed rockets

## Goal
This is an attempt to design and build a model rocket airframe which is nearly
100% 3d printed.  This is an exercise in both design and manufacturing of airframes
using additive manufacturing.

The airframe itself will be a 24mm minimum diameter rocket capable of carrying
a small payload such as a Jolly Logic altimeter.  This will allow the various
manufacturing decisions such as layer height to be studied in regards to rocket
performance.

## Pre Design Tests
Two different tolerance parameters need to be studied prior to creating the CAD
files for the rocket.  The first is the inner diameter of the main body tube to
ensure that the as manufactured part will accept a commercial 24mm motor.  The
second is the outer diameter of the coupler which will mate with the body tube.
A series of test parts will be designed with different sizes.  This data will
allow the CAD to be generated.  

One issue with this part of the design is that different printers with different
filament and slicer settings might yield different results.
